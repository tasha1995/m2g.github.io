<p>I'm just texting things out for now!</p>

  ###### Things to test out with Markdown:
  1. Italics can be done two ways. With *asterisks* and with _underscores_.
  2. Bold can also be done two ways; **asterisks** and with __underscores__. I guess it depends on preference.
  3. these ways of emphasis can be combined by just utilising both asterisks and _underscores_**.
  4. ~~You can also ommit things using tildes.~~
